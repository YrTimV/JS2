# Lesson 06

## Advanced feedback form validation (with UI effects)
* Added a **Birthday** field to choose a date from a convenient UI calendar (with a **yyyy/mm/dd** format). Required field with regexp validation.

## Addition to the simple cart module (drag & drop)
* Redesigned the cart module with a few goods and a shopping cart empty feature. Added a drag & drop feature for goods (to add to the cart) and the cart (to empty it).
